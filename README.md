# SwiftH3

This is a simple library to interface with [H3](https://github.com/uber/h3), a hexagonal hierarchical geospatial indexing system.

## Installation

_Currently only support for macOS_

1. You must have h3 installed:
    * `brew install h3`
2. Add this to your `Package.swift` (or add via Xcode 11):
    * `.package(url: "https://github.com/bdotdub/SwiftH3.git", from: "0.0.1")`

## Examples

TBD
